Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock: The C++ Game
==============================================

Part 1: Why?
------------

This was just a project.  Nothing more.  I had fun making it, but it's an assignment and nothing else.

Part 2: How does the computer pick?
------------------------------------

Entropy.  Just using the rand() % 5 + 1 function to pick a random number between 1 and 5.

Part 3: Playing
---------------

Just compile and enjoy.
